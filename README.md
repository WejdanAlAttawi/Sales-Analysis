# Sales Analysis


In this project I used python to analyize a dataset to extract the needed information from it, the dataset consists of 12 months of sales.

I answered 4 important questions from business perspictive

# First question: What was the best month for sales? And how much was earned that month?
From the chart I generated it seemed like December had the highest sales rate due to the holidays season, quantity earned was 28114.

# Second question: What city sold the most product?
The city that sold the most products was San Fracisco


# Third question: what time should we display advertisements to increase the chance of customer's purchase?
12(12pm) and 19(7pm) are peaks so it is best to put up an ad right before those times

# Fourth question: what products are likely sold together?
From the table I generated we can see that Google Phone and Wired Headphones are normally purchased together, because those two products have the same Order ID and they are delivered to the same address
